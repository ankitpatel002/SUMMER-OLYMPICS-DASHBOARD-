# SUMMER-OLYMPICS-DASHBOARD-

I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize the results of the Summer Olympics from 1896 to 2020, aiming to provide an in-depth analysis of the games over the years. The dashboard features several key performance indicators (KPIs), including the total number of sports, countries, and players, along with counts for gold, silver, bronze, and total medals awarded.

To enhance user interactivity, I integrated slicers for year, sport, country, and gender, allowing viewers to filter and explore the data based on their interests. The dashboard includes a detailed table that lists countries alongside their respective medal counts, providing an easy reference for comparing performances. Another table focuses on athletes, showcasing their names, gender, and total medals won, highlighting the achievements of individual competitors.

For visual representation, I incorporated two stacked column charts. The first chart illustrates the seasonal medal trends, allowing users to see how performances have varied across different Olympic years. The second chart breaks down total medals by age and gender, providing insights into how different demographics have fared in the games. Additionally, I created a line chart for gender-wise trend analysis, which offers a historical perspective on how male and female athletes' performances have evolved over time.

To complement these visuals, I've included a map that displays the total medals won by each country, making it easy to identify which nations have excelled in the Olympics. This geographical representation adds another layer of insight into the global nature of the games.
